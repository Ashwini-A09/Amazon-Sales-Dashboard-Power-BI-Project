# 🚀 Amazon-Sales-Dashboard-Power-BI-Project
This dashboard provides a clear overview of Amazon sales performance — highlighting customer behavior, seasonal trends, product category performance, and regional insights. It allows stakeholders to explore trends across time, geography, and sales channels using dynamic filters and visuals.

# 🔍 Overview
This Power BI report analyzes sales data from a fictional Amazon dataset to uncover insights on sales trends, product performance, regional distribution, and customer behavior. The dashboard provides an interactive and visually engaging overview of key metrics, helping stakeholders understand what drives sales, profit, and returns across segments and time periods.
This Amazon Sales Dashboard was created as part of the Power BI with AI Workshop conducted by OfficeMaster. The workshop provided the dataset and guided us through building AI-powered, interactive dashboards efficiently using Power BI.
